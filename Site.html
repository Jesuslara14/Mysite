					HTML, (Hyper text markup language), is a acripting computer language. It is the primary language used to 
					create static web page, in other words,s most, if not all webpages tha you have visited in the past use HTML as their
					base code language. <br> <br>
					The syntax used for HTML programming is rather simple, and consists of a system of tags which; depending on their 
					type, can take and render information located in between a valid starting and ending tag of the same type, as well 
					as parameters within the starting tag intself, such as:
					<ul>
						<dl>
							<dt>- Ids</dt>
							<dd>Gives the tag an id from which it can be unically be called without the rest of it's type being affected by the caller function.</dd>
							<dt>- Style</dt>
							<dd>Takes in multiple parameters which modify the style of the rendering depending on it's type. (Not the best option)</dd>
							<dt>- Src</dt>
							<dd>Takes a source of the tag type and renders it depending on such.</dd>
						</dl>
					</ul>
					HTML alone will not make a good website however. And as you have (hopefully) noticed by now, every website comes
					with some sort of aesthetic. And although most of that pretty coloring and positionings can be achieved through the style 
					parameter, such is not the best way of achieving the aesthetically pleasing content present in most HTML based websites.
					The best way of achieveing this is of course: a CSS file! a CSS file contains various rulesets within it which define
					the way in which various specific components within the HTML file will be rendered in the webpage, and when used correctily,
					can create beautiful visuals in your html based page. A CSS File can be linked to an HTML document at the head and 
					if programmed correctly will make a website have a pleasing look. <br> <br>
					In conclusion, HTML is a very simple yet powerful language, and when combined with the right programs and styling files,
					can create some pretty impressive websites.
